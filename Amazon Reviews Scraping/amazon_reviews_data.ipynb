This is my first apple device. I upgraded from OP7T to this device. My prime requirement was superior battery life and looking for an overall decent good phone. So I was initially inclined to buying OP 11 but ever since OP was acquired by VIVO, I felt that OP has lost its originality and as a result my interest for OP11 was somehow withdrawn.  After one month of usage of IP14+,  I find that in some aspect IOS is superior to android and in some other aspects android is superior to IOS. As a very normal mobile phone user, I’ll try to highlight the difficulties and good aspects of the device I noticed while using it for the last one month:Pros:1. Battery life is outstanding. When I was using single sim, I was having 40-42 hrs. of battery backup with moderate usage ( I don’t play games, moderate usage includes streaming content in Netflix, Hotstar etc. for 2-3 hrs.). When I started using duel sim also, the battery life is easily lasting for more than 36 hrs.2. I absolutely liked the Face ID feature and I really appreciate the security features offered by IOS. Be it for banking app or for any other apps, no unnecessary third party apps are required for protection & privacy of apps. My child can’t install any gaming app without my Faceid and it is such a relief.3. Astounding sound quality. This phone bar delivers amazing sound output. You’ll experience absolute satisfaction while watching content in this phone with such high quality sound output. My wife is using Galaxy S22 Ultra and I find that the sound output of IP14+ is superior to this.4. I read that screen refresh rate is 60Hz, but it hardly mattered to me. I could not notice any distraction due to this in my day to day activities. But I must say that watching content in S22 Ultra is more eye-pleasing but this does not mean that screen quality of IP14+ is any less than the S22 series.5. Duel 12 megapixel camera offers you such incredible picture quality that many flagship android phones with triple/ quadruple camera having fancy megapixels should feel ashamed of. Day or night , you get awesome photos. No unnecessary beautifying of photos , you simply see what you click. If I look bad, the camera will show me just like that. Video quality is also great specially in cinematic mode.6. Lesser battery & lesser ram than most of the android phones out there but performs like a beast non-stop.Cons:1. Android is so easy to use. It gives you the liberty to do as per your own terms. As a very normal user of mobile , simple activities like toggling with SIM data, choosing the sim to call, auto connection of Bluetooth with car (once it is paired), browsing the file manager, copying & pasting any files to & from the mobile device, connecting a SSD / pen drive etc. is such a piece of cake in android phones.  In IOS, calls will only go from the primary sim. You do not get the choice of selecting the sim to call your contacts. You can call a contact from your secondary sim only if you received a call from the caller in the secondary sim. I normally toggle between Jio & Airtel for mobile data. Toggling the mobile data is so damn easy in android phones through drop down menu but in IOS I have to go to settings everytime to select the primary / secondary sim for default data.2. File browsing in IOS is another nightmare for me. In 1 month I started missing the android file browsing utility. I can not copy a file from external source (pendrive / ssd) to iphone.  When connected to PC, I am only allowed to copy camera photos and videos to PC. May be IOS is restricting all these to enhance security of the device which I really appreciate but can’t help forgetting the swiftness of android handling all these shortcomings.3. Can you imagine, the calculator app can not handle any sum involving more than 9 digits.4. As I said camera in this phone is great. But I paid 90 thousand for the phone and for the price paid for I at least deserved a macro lens and 3x optical zoom lens in the camera system. Forget about macro photography & zooming if you are sticking with non-pro versions.Anyways, pro’s & con’s makes a product perfect. Despite all the shortfalls which are bothering me,  I liked this device because in many other important aspects it outperformed other flagship android devices. In the end  I must say, for battery, ram management and security IOS rocks and for ease of use android rocks.'}, {'author': 'Pritam Shetty', 'rating & title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\\nSmooth Transition to iPhone 14 Plus', 'text': \"I recently made the switch from Android to the iPhone 14 Plus, and it has been a remarkably smooth transition.

This is my first apple device. I upgraded from OP7T to this device. My prime requirement was superior battery life and looking for an overall decent good phone. So I was initially inclined to buying OP 11 but ever since OP was acquired by VIVO, I felt that OP has lost its originality and as a result my interest for OP11 was somehow withdrawn.  After one month of usage of IP14+,  I find that in some aspect IOS is superior to android and in some other aspects android is superior to IOS. As a very normal mobile phone user, I’ll try to highlight the difficulties and good aspects of the device I noticed while using it for the last one month:Pros:1. Battery life is outstanding. When I was using single sim, I was having 40-42 hrs. of battery backup with moderate usage ( I don’t play games, moderate usage includes streaming content in Netflix, Hotstar etc. for 2-3 hrs.). When I started using duel sim also, the battery life is easily lasting for more than 36 hrs.2. I absolutely liked the Face ID feature and I really appreciate the security features offered by IOS. Be it for banking app or for any other apps, no unnecessary third party apps are required for protection & privacy of apps. My child can’t install any gaming app without my Faceid and it is such a relief.3. Astounding sound quality. This phone bar delivers amazing sound output. You’ll experience absolute satisfaction while watching content in this phone with such high quality sound output. My wife is using Galaxy S22 Ultra and I find that the sound output of IP14+ is superior to this.4. I read that screen refresh rate is 60Hz, but it hardly mattered to me. I could not notice any distraction due to this in my day to day activities. But I must say that watching content in S22 Ultra is more eye-pleasing but this does not mean that screen quality of IP14+ is any less than the S22 series.5. Duel 12 megapixel camera offers you such incredible picture quality that many flagship android phones with triple/ quadruple camera having fancy megapixels should feel ashamed of. Day or night , you get awesome photos. No unnecessary beautifying of photos , you simply see what you click. If I look bad, the camera will show me just like that. Video quality is also great specially in cinematic mode.6. Lesser battery & lesser ram than most of the android phones out there but performs like a beast non-stop.Cons:1. Android is so easy to use. It gives you the liberty to do as per your own terms. As a very normal user of mobile , simple activities like toggling with SIM data, choosing the sim to call, auto connection of Bluetooth with car (once it is paired), browsing the file manager, copying & pasting any files to & from the mobile device, connecting a SSD / pen drive etc. is such a piece of cake in android phones.  In IOS, calls will only go from the primary sim. You do not get the choice of selecting the sim to call your contacts. You can call a contact from your secondary sim only if you received a call from the caller in the secondary sim. I normally toggle between Jio & Airtel for mobile data. Toggling the mobile data is so damn easy in android phones through drop down menu but in IOS I have to go to settings everytime to select the primary / secondary sim for default data.2. File browsing in IOS is another nightmare for me. In 1 month I started missing the android file browsing utility. I can not copy a file from external source (pendrive / ssd) to iphone.  When connected to PC, I am only allowed to copy camera photos and videos to PC. May be IOS is restricting all these to enhance security of the device which I really appreciate but can’t help forgetting the swiftness of android handling all these shortcomings.3. Can you imagine, the calculator app can not handle any sum involving more than 9 digits.4. As I said camera in this phone is great. But I paid 90 thousand for the phone and for the price paid for I at least deserved a macro lens and 3x optical zoom lens in the camera system. Forget about macro photography & zooming if you are sticking with non-pro versions.Anyways, pro’s & con’s makes a product perfect. Despite all the shortfalls which are bothering me,  I liked this device because in many other important aspects it outperformed other flagship android devices.
